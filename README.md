Cassandra on Docker
===================

This is a collection of images and scripts to help you run Cassandra 2.1 in Docker containers cloned from poklet/cassandra. Main difference:

* using cassandra 2.1

Everything else works as described here https://github.com/pokle/cassandra except that the image name is *matlockx/cassandra_2.1*:

```bash
docker run -d -name cass1 matlockx/cassandra_2.1
```
